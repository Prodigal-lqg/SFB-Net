# SFBNet: Semantic‚ÄìFrequency Boundary Network

## üå± Introduction
SFBNet (Semantic‚ÄìFrequency Boundary Network) is a multi-task deep learning framework for agricultural parcel delineation from high-resolution remote sensing imagery.
It introduces two complementary modules:
1. **Complementary Semantic Attention (CSA)**  
   Enhances cross-scale semantic consistency.
   Stabilizes region‚Äìboundary alignment through spatial priors and channel interactions.  

2. **Frequency-domain Boundary Enhancement Module (FBEM)**  
   Incorporates frequency-domain modeling to refine boundary sharpness.
   Produces continuous and accurate boundaries even under low-contrast or complex textures.

## Data Preprocessing
This study utilizes remote sensing datasets from both the Netherlands and Denmark.
Netherlands dataset covers typical intensive agricultural areas, where parcels are generally large and heterogeneous, while also including some small irregular fields. After cropping the images into 256√ó256 patches and discarding samples with less than 30% parcel coverage, the dataset consists of 4,970 training samples, 1,243 validation samples, and 1,041 testing samples

Denmark dataset is characterized by fragmented and irregular parcels distributed in terrain-influenced heterogeneous landscapes. Such parcels often exhibit weak or discontinuous boundaries, posing greater challenges for accurate delineation. Similar to the Netherlands dataset, the images and annotations were cropped into 256√ó256 patches, and samples with less than 30% parcel coverage were discarded. According to the defined partition strategy, the red-marked regions (A, B, D, F, G) were assigned to the training set, the green-marked regions (C, E) to the validation set, and the remaining regions to the test set. In total, the Denmark dataset contains 5,535 training samples, 1,383 validation samples, and 1,297 testing samples

To further enhance model generalization, multiple data augmentation techniques were applied during training, including random flipping, mirroring, Gaussian noise, contrast adjustment, scaling, and mix-up. These augmentations effectively increased sample diversity and alleviated the negative impact of parcel fragmentation and blurred boundaries.
## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prodigal-lqg/SFB-Net.git
cd SFB-Net

```
## üöÄ Usage
Run the following example to test the model:

```python
import torch
from SFB-Net import Field

model = Field()
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

outputs = model(x)
mask, edge, distance = outputs
```
## üöÄ Usage
Netherlands: large heterogeneous parcels.

Denmark: small irregular parcels with weak boundaries.
