# SFBNet: Semantic‚ÄìFrequency Boundary Network

## üå± Introduction
SFBNet (Semantic‚ÄìFrequency Boundary Network) is a multi-task deep learning framework for agricultural parcel delineation from high-resolution remote sensing imagery.
It introduces two complementary modules:
1. **Complementary Semantic Attention (CSA)**  
   Enhances cross-scale semantic consistency.
   Stabilizes region‚Äìboundary alignment through spatial priors and channel interactions.  

2. **Frequency-domain Boundary Enhancement Module (FBEM)**  
   Incorporates frequency-domain modeling to refine boundary sharpness.
   Produces continuous and accurate boundaries even under low-contrast or complex textures.

## Data Preprocessing
1.We crop the original images and their corresponding annotations into 256√ó256 patches to standardize the input size for training.

2.Patches with less than 30% parcel coverage are discarded to reduce class imbalance, and the remaining data are split into 5,499 training samples, 1,376 validation samples, and 1,208 testing samples to ensure a balanced dataset for model development and evaluation.

3.We apply multiple data augmentation techniques, including flipping, mirroring, Gaussian noise, contrast adjustment, scaling, and mix-up, to enhance sample diversity and improve model generalization..


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prodigal-lqg/SFB-Net.git
cd SFB-Net

```
## üöÄ Usage
Run the following example to test the model:

```python
import torch
from CSGMNet import Field

model = Field()
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 256, 256)

outputs = model(x)
mask, edge, distance = outputs
```
## üöÄ Usage
Netherlands: large heterogeneous parcels.

Denmark: small irregular parcels with weak boundaries.
